## Personal Website
Welcome to my personal website! This is the repository where you can find the source code to my website. The website was developed by me with some of the more complex css adapted from free online css resources. This website is being continually updated and maintained. The website is best viewed on Macs, but it should work on many different machines. Tracks interesting user data using Google Analytics! 

In addition, the site now features an automated “Analytics” section that pulls in up-to-date YouTube channel stats (views, subscribers, watch time, and videos) from a daily script, so the dashboard you see on the Analytics page reflects live metrics from my channel.
